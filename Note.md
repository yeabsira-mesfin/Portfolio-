# An intentet is simply a wire, and a computer connected directly to a wire is called a server.
# Computers we use are called clients since they are not connceted to the the internet directly.
# Everthing connected to the internet has and address called (IP Address)
# Anywhere where two or more parts of the internet intersect there is an equipment called router, which direct our packets to the internet which help us to get more closer to the internet.
# When an information is sent to the server our computer's IP address will be added to the routers IP address and it will reach the destination, then when the information comes back from the internet the IP address is unfolded to the IP addresses it held when it came first.


# HTTP (Hyper text transfer protocol) s(secure.) 


# Three main methods are attached to HTTPS, GET (requests data), POST (submit data to the server), (PUT) update data which is already on the server, and DELETE(deletes our data.)
# The main difference between put and patch is that put updates it entirely and patch updates incrementaly only the specified target.
# Rarely used method are Head: same as get but doesn't return a body. Options: returns the supported HTTP methods. Patch: update partial resources.

# 200 - means ok, 201 - ok created, 301 - moved to new URL, 304- means not modified, 400 - Bad request, 401 - unauthorized, 404 - not found and 500 internal server error


# GIT is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files.
# You can snapshot your code history by making a commit.
# git init - initialize local git repository
# git add <file> add files to index
# git status check status of working tree
# git commit commit changes in index
# git pull pull latest version from the remote repository
# git clone clone repository into your local files.


# NPM (node package manager): it is pre installed with Node. 
# Package.js manifest file with app info, lists dependencies (name and version), specify if versions should be updated, create Npm scripts, and is easily created with "npm init"



# You can use JavaScript for different things such as for a browser, interactive user interface using javascript based frameworks like React, it can also be used in mobile development and desktop application development.


# Var is not used since it makes declares a global variable where it can be harmful in some cases.
# JS values were represented as a type tag and was represented as null pointer (0x00 on most platforms)


# In primitive dataypes, values are dircetly associated with memory. (sting,number,boolean...)
# As a result, null had 0 as a type tag, hence the bogus typeof return value(refernce)
# We have to convert our JS to JASON format to send it to the the server.


# DOM (Document Object Model)

# API: (Aplication Program Infterface): it includes a structured request and response.

# Best analogy I've got is the restaurant model, where you order a food and then recieve.
# Here in this example your are web application where you order different requests and the kitchen is the server where things are proccessed and the waiter is the API that
# takes and bring order and responses.

# REST(Representational State Transfer): a building style to design networked applications. And it depends on stateless client-server protocol.

# REST API: API is the messanger and REST let's us use HTTP request to format those messages. 

# End points: The URI/ URL where api/service can be accessed by a client application.


#  A token refers to the smallest individual units of a program. Such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and punctuation.


# PORT refers to a virtual communication endpoint between different processes or services running on a computer. Ports are used to facilitate communication between these processes over a network.

# Ports are identified by numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535. Ports from 0 to 1023 are reserved for well-known services, such as HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), while ports from 1024 to 49151 are registered for specific purposes by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Ports from 49152 to 65535 are available for dynamic or private use

# CRUD (create, read, update and delete.)

# React is a JS library/framework for building user interfaces.
# Websites are looked in terms of components.

# Props are attributes
# States are datas that a component hold and manages internally.
# Hooks allows us to use state and other features within functional components with out writing a class
# useContext, useMemo & useCallback will be phased out in React 19.

# SPA(Single Page App) - Loads a single HTML file and JS loads the entire UI including routes.
# SSR(Server-Side Rendered) - Server sends rendered page to client. You can fetch data and load it as well.
# SSG(Static Site Generation) - Meta framework generates static HTML files at build times. 

# <></> and empty tag in html is called fragment.
